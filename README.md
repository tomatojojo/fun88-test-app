Uses Next.js and React.

Just `npm run dev` for local run.
Or use this link: https://fun88-test-app.vercel.app/

### Use the mobile view when viewing in desktops or laptops as the app was made for mobile view.

Took around 6 hours to make the logic and the basic frontend.
Took another 4 hours to transfer expressjs to nextjs and deploy with vercel.

CSS files are all organized under the styles folder to make it easier for icon changes, size adjustments to the tabs, etc.
Components folder contains the frontend related views of the app. Only Tabs.tsx has the api requests.
